# Film-Profit-Predictor
Do the director, budget, year/month/day of release, votes etc., influence the profit a movie makes?

Needed a little distraction from job hunting so I took up this dataset since I'm a huge movie buff. I did some data visualizations to extract insights on highest grossing films, people's choice films, ROI per gender etc. At the end of this, I asked myself if I could predict the profit a movie makes based on the attributes mentioned in these datasets. So, I built a decision tree, lasso regression and random forest model, with hyperparameter tuning to see which model performs the best.
